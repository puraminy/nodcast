              NodCast is a reading environment that turns text into a responsive
              conversation.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - '@how?'
                - interesting!
              reflective:
                - so what?
            questions:
              - '@What does it mean for reading to become conversational?'
          - id: ''
            text: >
              Instead of passively scanning lines, you react to each sentence
              with short signals called nods
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!
              reflective:
                - '@nods?!'
            questions:
              - '@What exactly are nods?'
              - How do they change the reading experience?
          - id: ''
            text: >-
              A nod is a quick acknowledgment — like saying I see or so — but
              written, not spoken.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - '@I see!'
                - well!
                - interesting!
              reflective: []
            questions:
              - '@Why would written nods matter?'
              - How do they help comprehension?

              Each sentence in a NodCast article is a small unit of interaction.
              After reading a sentence, you choose a nod that reflects your
              understanding, confusion or curiosity. By responding as you read,
              you stay mentally active and track what parts of the text spark
              questions or clarity.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!
              reflective:
                - didn't get
            questions:
              - '@What kinds of nods can I choose from?'
          - id: ''
            text: >-
              There are two broad types: affirming nods like I get it, and
              reflective ones like not sure or wait, what?
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - '@I see!'
              reflective:
                - what?
            questions:
              - '@What does NodCast do with these responses?'
          - id: ''
            text: >-
              NodCast learns which parts of the text engage you or confuse you
              by observing the patterns of nods you make. In later versions,
              your nod history could personalize reading speed, difficulty, or
              even suggest explanations.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!
              reflective:
                - '@didn''t get'
            questions:
              - '@So nods become a feedback signal to the system itself?'

            text: >-
              To make nodding fast and fluid, NodCast suggests possible nods
              beneath each sentence. Suggested nods appear just below the active
              line, and you can cycle through them quickly without leaving the
              text.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!
              reflective:
                - didn't get
            questions:
              - How are these suggestions chosen?
              - '@Can I still write my own custom nods?'
          - id: ''
            text: >-
              Yes. You can edit or create your own nods, which helps NodCast
              better understand your personal reading habits.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!
              reflective:
                - didn't get
            questions:
              - '@Does the interface make that easy to do?'

              the text.

          - id: ''
            text: >-
              Use the Right arrow for affirmative nods and the Left arrow for
              reflective ones.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!

          - id: ''
            text: >-
              Press Down to advance to the next sentence or Up to revisit the
              previous one.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!

          - id: ''
            text: >-
              Readers often describe it as conversational, like listening to
              someone explain an idea while you respond quietly.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!

              By pausing on each sentence, you slow down just enough to
              understand its logic before moving forward.
            nods:
              affirmative:
                - I see!

              Yes, you can move sentence by sentence or switch to paragraph mode
              for faster review.
            nods:
              affirmative:

              Each nod can be expanded into a short comment or note, helping you
              connect ideas as you go.
            nods:
              affirmative:
