# NodCast

NodCast is a keyboard-driven, text-based reading platform designed for focused, distraction-free engagement with articles and scientific papers. It introduces a novel method for reading and writing by allowing readers to interact with text through short written signals called **nods**, track comprehension, and flag ambiguous or challenging sections.

Articles can be annotated dynamically, and your interactions provide feedback for understanding and coherence, helping both readers and writers improve the reading experience.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Reading**: Engage with each sentence via affirming or reflective nods.
- **Custom Feedback**: Add your own nods and questions to capture points of confusion or reasoning gaps.
- **Read Aloud**: Supports Google Text-to-Speech for listening to articles while reading.
- **Keyboard-Centric Navigation**: Designed for smooth terminal interaction with minimal distractions.

## Installation

**Note:** NodCast is primarily designed and tested on **Linux**. It can run on **Windows**, but you may experience flickering or minor display issues that require further adjustments.

To install:

```bash
pip install nodcast
